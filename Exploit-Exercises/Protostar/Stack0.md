### Stack 0:
-------------------------------------
#### Source Code:
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

#### Exploitation:
We first need to have a basic understanding as to how these Stack Based Buffer-Overflows are performed. This one is the most easiest one that can be performed. Our goal is to overwrite the `modified` variable that has been set to `0`. And, we know that the buffer can hold upto `64` values. And, lastly, input is being taken using the `gets()` function which itself is a vulnerable function. So, if we provide more than 64 values, our modified value will be overwritten. We'll be using python to pipe 64 values into the program using: `python -c "print 'A'*64 | ./stack0"`

Now, if we try and provide more than 64 values, our buffer will be overflowed and the value of modified will be overwritten. Now, piping 65 characters using: `python -c "print 'A'*65 | ./stack0"`:
